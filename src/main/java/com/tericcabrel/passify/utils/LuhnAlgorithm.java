     * Luhn Class is an implementation of the Luhn algorithm that checks validity of a credit card number.
     *
     * @author <a href="http://www.chriswareham.demon.co.uk/software/Luhn.java">Chris Wareham</a>
     * @version Checks whether a string of digits is a valid credit card number according to the Luhn algorithm. 1. Starting with the second to last digit and
     *           moving left, double the value of all the alternating digits. For any digits that thus become 10 or more, add their digits together. For example,
     *           1111 becomes 2121, while 8763 becomes 7733 (from (1+6)7(1+2)3). 2. Add all these digits together. For example, 1111 becomes 2121, then 2+1+2+1 is
     *           6; while 8763 becomes 7733, then 7+7+3+3 is 20. 3. If the total ends in 0 (put another way, if the total modulus 10 is 0), then the number is valid
     *           according to the Luhn formula, else it is not valid. So, 1111 is not valid (as shown above, it comes out to 6), while 8763 is valid (as shown
     *           above, it comes out to 20).
     * @param cardNumber
     *            the credit card number to validate.
     * @return <b>true</b> if the number is valid, <b>false</b> otherwise.
